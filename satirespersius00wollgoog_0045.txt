THE FlIlS'l' sanna 01² PERSIUS· l7

Whoe'er has felt the hold Cratinus' roge, θ’)
’ Or pallid grown at Eupolis’s page,
Or leis, as great in pow'rs as age-look here,
And if aught more refinell and pure appear,
'l'hen turn yet warm to me with fav' ring ear.
Here none who meanly rails‘at folks who wear 190
Their shoes tied on with philosophie air,
who in plain trun wan ten a min ne squints,
And thinks it wit-who at his honours hints‚' ’·
1 Because as'AEdile of a paltry state
He struts about, and breaks the choating weight τ
Nor one who sand and horn-books would despise,
And ridicule the way to make men wisa,
Who chuokles if, in publio as he goes,
A strumpet tweaks a Cynio by the nose :
To suoh as these, for pastime I deoree

Ediots hy day, at night Callirhoe. (Ἀ)
