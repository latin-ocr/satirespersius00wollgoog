to the original Satirist the character osa Poet, much
less can a Translator lay claim to such a distinction.

—-- “ neque si quis scribat, ati nos,
Sermoni propiora, putes hanc esse Poetam.
Ingenium cui sit, cai mens divinior, atque os
Magna santonum, des nominis hujus honorem.¹'
Hoa. Sat. 4, l. 61, ν. 41.

In this attempt indeed, it having been the chief object
of the Translator to keep as close as possible to his
author, hc would have found little room for the display
of poetic talent, had he possessed it; and he has only
to hope that he may be found to have kept clear of
mean and hemely, or inappropriate diction, though he
cannot expect to have found a language in any degree
worthy of the original.

In the course of the undertaking he has avoided
borrowing from the published labours of others, though
he has occasionally consulted former translations, and
compared them with his own. To name Dryden, and
to have ventured upon the same ground with him, may
appear bold and presuming3 but it may be admitted
that the coarseness of some of his lines is not suitable ,
to the taste of the present age3 and besides, Dryden's
Satires are not regular translations, but in many parts
deviate into parody and imitation. Drummond’s verses
are elegant and highly finished, and would read wellas
