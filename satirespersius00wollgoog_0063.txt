Tun secono snum 01³ Phasma. 35

As much as dolls, on Venus' altar laid,

Pay to the Deity, or help the maid.

Give then, what prouti Messala’s blear-ey'd race (Η)

Oen never on their plenteous table place,

A heart where piety and justice rest,

Inwardly sound, by generous thoughts imprest.

Give me but these to offer at theshrine,¹

And one small cehe shall sooth the pow’rs divine. 108
