So sang old Ennius, when he oeas’d to onore, ‘⁴'

Dreaming his soul hod from a Peaoook poss’d,

Fisth in descent-how his strange lot was cast!

How Homer first he was—and Ennius last!

Here I retire, from noise and strife released‚ 20
'Careless what flooks may feel the blasting east,

Careless if dr’angle in my neighbour's field (ω

Α more abundant orop than mine should yield ε

And tho’ around me many I may see,

Loss nobly born, but much more rich than me,

Yet shall not age for this my strength reduce,

Nor will Ι in my board be less profuse,

Nor lose my daimies‚ nor, with miser’s eye, ’

The vapid liquor’s seal minutely spy.

All think not thusssnurs’d by the sels-samo star, 30

E’en twins by blood, in tempor differ far.

This, on his birth-day only will afford,

To dip in purchased brine his musty homd,

From the small cup—himself, with selfish care,
Sprinkling his sacred pepper on his fare.

Tlre other, will his generous blood display,

And eat up his whole fortune in a day.

But I of what I’ve got will make good use,

I'll use3 but neither with a board profuse,

On pamper'd freodmen oostly turbots waste, 40
Nor choose hen thmshes for their daintior toste.

Live on your means 3 from your stor’d granaries feed3
Fear not-plough on-and crop will crop suoceed.
