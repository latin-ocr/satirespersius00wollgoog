But if my freeborn spirit nise,
And scetter to the winde end skiee
These folliee, that my bosom fill,
And only aggrevete the ill;

Subdued, my pride and shame wilt yield,

And to my rivale quit the field.

When thus to thee I hed consess’d, .
And'grevely my resolve prosess’dt

Yon bade nte seek my hetne in penne.
