THE

PROLOGUE TO THE SATIRES.

——-—

Daronn considers this as the Prologue to the
First Satire3 but the Delphin and other editors treat
it as the Prologue to the Satires generally,'to which
it seems as well adopted as to the first singly. Many
conjectures bave been offered as to its meaning and
intention. But as the Satires were written in the most
dangerous days of the Empire, and might, in some
passages, have been suspected of being personally di-
rected against the reigning Emperor, it may reasonably
be supposed that, when they were banded about, and
copies of them were multiplied, the author would wish
to conceal himself, by assuming a character which did
not belong to him, and describing himself as a poor
Poet writing for bread. Th'e Prologue bas in it much
of the peculiar manner of the Poet3 that closeness of
language, and comprehensiveness of meaning, which so
distinguish him, and which it is quite impossible to
follow, and very difficult to express in a translation.
