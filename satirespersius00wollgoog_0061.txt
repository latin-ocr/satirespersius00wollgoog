THE SEGOND SA'HBB ΟΡ PERSIUS· 33

If a rioh friend a oostly present makes,
Goblets and bowls emboss'd-see, how it shakes
Your every nerve—yon tremble and you glow, -
Large drops of sweat your panting transport shew.
Hence this suggestion rose, and we behold ⁴⁹³

= The sacred vissges bedauh'd with gold,

Ovetions’ relies-Let ns then but ohuse
Theseos the· hrazen brothers, who diffuse 80
'Phe best and purest dreams-on them be smear'sl
The fair distinction of a golden beard.
The simple vessels, pious Numa’s care,

Gold now supplanto, the uro and Tusean ware.
Ο earth-born Souls! by earth-born passinus led, (Ν)

Το every spark of heev’nly influenoe deadl

Think ye thet what man values, will inspiro

In minds celestial the same base desirel

Thet this corrupted flesh of onrs below,

Can ought oi good on Gods above bestowl 90
’Tis tto that makes the olive's simple juioe,

With Cassia’s spice, the rieh perfume produee;

That taints Calabria’s fleeee with purple dye;

Extraets the pearl; and bids the forge supply

Metallio stores. 'Tis tlte that thrives in ill,

Sins andeins on, and profits by it still-

Say then, ye Priests! doth gold the Gods delight,

Or give to holy things a holier ritel 100
