Jove sor tho good this favour'd region placed,
Ere th’ age os gold to brass debased,
Harden'd still more in iron chain was bound,
From which this refuge still was found 3
Whither‚ if bards may truly prophecy‚
Our'virtuous citizens may fly.

Epona XVII. To Canidia. Apreteaded fflcantcthn.

Yes‚ yos, I-own thy sov'reign away,
And to thy potent oharms give way: ι
Suppliant, I deprecate thy spell,
By Proserpina, the Queen of Hell;
By stern Diana's stedfast look3
By mystic verses in thy book,

’ That can the lights of heav’n unfix,
And stars in wild confusion mix5
Let me no more thy curses feel,
Canidia! 'sparet untwine thy rael.
'l'he pardon of great Thetis’ son,
By humbled Telephus was won;
Tho' he had brought his armies near,
And 'gainst him hurl'd his angry spear.
'l'he Trojan matrona were allowed
To wrap fierce Hector in his shroudy κ
