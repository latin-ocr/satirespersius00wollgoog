THE men surm OF HUIUS.

Some now their ekill in hold heroice try‚‘¹¹'
content before with Greciun melody3
Unskilful artists, even when they ehuee

The well known subjecte of the rustic muse,

The groves, the cottuges, the teeming lund,

These humble themes all fail beneeth their hand:
Both pige and ponltry, feasts und jovial nights,
When Pales' ernoke the rustic train delights: lto
Whenee Remus and illustrions Quintus l Thou,
Whose timid consort oull’d thee from the plough,
And threw the rohe of office o'er thy head,

While hie tired beosts the lictor homeword led.

But on', my Poet! for in this our age

Hearers there are who to old Aooius' pege,

Who to Pooouvius, their fovonr'ohow,

On harsh Antiope appleuse benten,

When “her grief-strichen heert inpropp’d by woe.”‘¹²’
If such sulse precepto hlear·ey'd sires instil, 120
And their boys' heudo with turgid nonsense fill,
Ought we to wonder, thet the bubbling nonnum>

Of senseless words should in this age aboundl

'l'hot the young smoothfao’d Trossuli should greetss‘l
Such otuff with transport from their knightly seat.

Is it not shnmeful you ean not desendfflt

The hoary heud from nn untimely end,

But you must strive in suoh'a desperate oense ¹
'l'o catch the saintest murmur of applause?
