The tund line in tbe original is omitted; line 73 is not translated
liternlly. lt afforde another instance oi the prurient imagination oi these
ancient Satirists. But the whole passage seems to allude to a loose and
disorderly connexion with Patrician indies, under tbe exeiternent oi high

(16) L. 116. How shall I stop? Chrysippus be my friend !

The last line oi this Sutire hus been the subject os almost ns rnueh
conjecture and commentary as that oi the first Satire. But there seems
no doubt that the allusion is to along string oi logical deductione one
arising out oi another, called a Sontes-attributed to Chrysippus, which
may be carried on indefinitely without leading to a reasonable conclusion.

, ln such difficulties, the more literal a translation is, the better; and if

the lines are obscure the excuse must be found in the original. The last
lines oi the Satire are put into the mouth oi the miser, who finding his
riches increase beyond his expectatione, knows not how to stop. The
observation already made oi the want oi a wiuding up, applies to this
Satine.
