When earthen goblets feam, and the coarse dish,
Scarce holds within its rim the spreading fish;
You move your silent lips, your colour’s ssed,
And with the circumcis'd the sabbath dread.
Then Black hobgoblins threaten and alarm3

A broken egg requires some hesling eharm.
Then monstrous Ganls are seen ln stslk about3
And one-ey'd minstrels, with their noisy tout,
Threaten diseases from the Gods‚ unless

Three bites of gerlie will their wreth· repress. 250
Amongst our brawny guerds should thisbe said,

The huge Pulfenius laughs end shskes his head,
And swears he would not give a single mite

Por scores of Greeks, with all their rule of right.
