unu eronus or nomon. 171

And bear his mangled oorse away ¹ '

From birds and beaute—theirlaw'ful prey-

When the old King had stoop'd to greet¹

The boon, at proud Achilles’ feet. 20
Ulysses' boatmen laid aside

Their bristled neoks and hardened hide,

Relieved by Ciroe’s wand, and then

Regained their looks, and talk'd like rnen.

Painful enough thy powers heve proved,

Ο thou! by orews end tradere loved!

My youth is gone, my oolour fied,

My skin on my dry bones looks dead:

By your perfumes my hair's tum’d grey 3

No rest from toil by night or doy; 30
anh urges on, nor may I heare

One sigh, my bosom to relieve.

Once I denied: but now I find,

That Sabine verse disturbs the mind:

Alos! too well oonvino’d‚ I dread

Lest Marsian ditties split my head.

What would you more? Ο earth! Ο seaol

Ι burn more fierce then Herculeo,

When smear'd by Nessus' poisonoue blood ;

More hot than AEtna’s flaming flood. 40
But you your Colchion nostrums ply,

While blown about by winde I fly, Δ

Light as e oinder and disperst.

But let me know, is this the norst?
