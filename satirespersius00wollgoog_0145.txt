'l'HB RPODBS OF HORACE.

Enonn I. To Maecenas.

Shell you in your light galley meet,
The lolly, well-arm’d, hostile fleetl
Sholl you, my friend, your life expose
With Caeser to his daring foes,

- While Ι,1 who only am alive

To joy and mirth 11 you survive,
Should feel myself, ifyou were gone,
A useless burdes, eud alone?

And shall I, os you wish, pursue

Thnt ease which all depends on youl
Or rather meet tho toil and esre

The hardy and the breve must beor?
Yes, Ι will follow, without seor,

Thoe, o’er the Alpino mountnins dreer,
E’en sevoge Caucasus transcend,

And western world's remotest end.

You ask rne, what relies could I,

A weak end timid wretc‘h, supplyl
Olose hy you I should seer the less:
More feors the absent friend possess:
The bird, her unfledg' d young in sight,
Dreeds 101 them less the serpent's bite,
Thon when she roonis to seek their food3
Though, present, will she seve. lter broodl
