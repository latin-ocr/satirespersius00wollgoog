rue rrrru sunau or euresius. 85

Now girt and ready for the oea, you paok
Hampers and knepsaoks on your servant's back,
And hurry to the port-soon would you sweep-
In your capacious ship the AEgoean deep,
Did not your old friend Luaury step in,
And artfully your favour aurive to win.
“ What are you doing, madman i think awhilet
“ Thia headlong whim has rais'd your heated uile,
“ Which hemloeh’s etrongest dreughta will not subdue.
, “ Ie a long voyage fit for such as you?
‘⁴ Would you, at supper with your metes, submit
“ On twisted oehles ’twixt two poste to sit?
“And ladle out from the broad-hottom'd jar,
“ Coarse muddy wine that smells of pitoh and tar?
“What would you have? are you not then content
“ With five, but must you eweat out tea, percont? 200
“ Come, let us rather luxuries enjoy‚
“ Indulge our genius, and our time employ
“ In pleasures whioh alone give life its zest3
‘⁴ You'll he e tale, and ashes, like the rest.
‘⁵ Live while we live, for death must come at laste ‘¹⁸’
‘⁴ Time flies, some momente while we talk have paet.’'
What in thie puzzling confliet oan you do?
Two baits are offer'd, ohoose between the two.
Which will you take? At last you will but play
Between them both, and change from day to day. 210
And boast not, isone victory you gain,

, Sooming commende, that you have snapp'd your· olraiu.
