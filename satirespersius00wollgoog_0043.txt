This is hut muwkish nonseuse‚ nothing worth,

Which from his lips tho Poet sputters forth 3¹¹⁸l

But he nor thumps his desk, nor gnaws his nuile.

M. But why such bitter truths to tendor eors l
Why suarl so shsrplyl Here you not your soors,

Lupus und Mutius, ’till his grinders gnash’d.
Sly Horace would our vices gently hit,

And while his loughing friend admird his wit,
Ploy’d round his beart-stringe, and without s fromn,

And to my tnhlets whisper what 1 knowrffll

And this my secret joke, this poltry staff,
So vile, so worthless held, I would not sell,
For nll your lliods that suceeed so wellssl
