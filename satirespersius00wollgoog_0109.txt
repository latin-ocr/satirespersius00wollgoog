'l'HE Plura strum OF Phasma. 81

Is th’ high-shod ploughman should propose to guida,
Unskill’d in 11111, avessel thro’ 1111 tide, Ι 130
Would not the soa-gods justly take offenoe,

And 11111111 0111 at such matohless impudeneel

Have you then from true wisdom caught the art, ‘¹²’

- To live uprightly, and to try the heart?

Whether like gold o’er haser metals spread,

Shining without, the sound betrays the 111111

Have you well mark'd those rules by which to know
What the wise man should shun, and what allow?

Are your desires in modest hounds conlin'dl

Your table temperate, your manners kindt 140
Have you learnt when to open or restrain,

With close or liberal hand, your 110111 01 grain?

Can you your eyes and watering lips withhold, ἵ
And pass unmoved before the tempting gold?

’111111 virtues if with confidenoe you claim,<¹³’

And time, the 1111 01 truth‚ oonfirms your fame,

The Gods will with the Praetors voice agree,

And to the world pronounos you wise aud free,

But 01111 our common nature doom'd to share,
11 you, unohang’d in skin, put on the air 150
01 polish’d life, and in false trappings drest,
Nourish low cunning in your vapid breast,
I draw the 1111111 in, my words recall,
Reason has giren you no weight at all:
Point but the finger, and you break our rules3 ‘¹⁴’

Not half a grain 01 good adheres to 100111
