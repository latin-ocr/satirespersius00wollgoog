nnn :nonos on nomon. 15⁷

’ Enonn XIII. To tis Friettde.

Dark storms defaee the heovens, the driving snow

And pelting raino bring down J ove's wrath below3

'l'he oens, the woodo roan with the Thracian blasto 3

Let uo employ this seeson while it laets,

And while our limbo ore sound, and when ¹we moy,
Drive oare, with oge's wrinkled from, away.

Old ao Torquatus' time bring forth the wine,

Let other ceres be hush'dxby help divine:

All will come right: now let rioh soents conspire‚
Perfumes from Persia, with the soothing lyre, 10
Cylene’s son's delight, to ease the breast

With fears and sad anxietiee opprees’d.

'Phe Centaur thus tohis great pupil sung:

“ Unoonquer'd mortali from a Goddess sprung!

“ Troy's ploins aweit} which oold Scamander laves,
“And gliding Simois with his soonty woveo;

‘⁴ But there the too-sure Fates have fix'd thy houm,
“Nor shall thy seo-born mother bring thee home:

“ lbere, then, with wine end musio seek relies 3

“ Nothing so sure to lighten pein end grief.'' 20
