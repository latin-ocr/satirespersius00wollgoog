THE SIXTH SATIRE.

*ιιι-

Ιτ appears by this address oi the Post to his friend, that it was the
custom with tho Romcnsas it is with us at present, to retire in the win-
terto enjoythe comiorts os a tire and a wermer climate, with the amuse-
ments sud the society oi s country lite. Tire object oi the Satire seems
to be to encourage the spending whatever income muy be possessed, in
the comiortsble and reasonable enjoymeut oi lite; sud to point out the
tolly oi suving s fortune, which may bc throwu away by those who
succeed to it, protnsely sud unwiseiy3 or boarded and sccumuiuted ior
no better purpose than the boust os richcs. This is the most pleusing of
the Satires, ns it shows the happy turn of the Poet’s mind, and lets us
into the occupatione and amusements os persons in his condition of lite,
os weil ns his wsrmth of affection ior his friend Bassus. The moral
lessons uiso ure excellent.
