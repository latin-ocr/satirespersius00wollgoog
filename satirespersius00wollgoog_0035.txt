“ Deam you this nothing l '' ‘⁷’ See amidst the rout

Of wine and feasting, Rome’s gay sons call out

Some favorite poem’s strain divine to hear ε

Behold in violet-colour’d robe appear

The trim reciter-who with drawling voice, (Β) 50

First gives a specimen of something choice,
Then picks out a sad tale their laste to plesse,

Of Philleses, or of Hypsipylen,

Melta in soft numbers, and with mincing lips,

His hals-form'd periods delicately clips:

The worthies praise-Shall not the Bard be blest,
And marble lie more lightly on his hreast?

The guests applaud-shall not his ashes glow,
And on his tomh the springing violets hlowl

But “ you're severc,'' the adversary cries, 60
“And laugh too lond-who does not highly prize

“The public voice? and would not leave behind
“ Effusions fit for shelves with cedar lined,

“ That need not sear the luckless fate of those
“Which high-dried fish or frankincense inclose l ''
Yon then, whose adverse arguments 1 use,
And into fancied dialogue diffuse,
Think not, if Ι, hy chance, should show some wit,
And make (a prodigy l) one happy hit,
That all your praises I should treat with somni 70
No, no! my ncrves are not made dull aa horn.
But that your ‘⁶ BravoS,'' and that sanseless cry,
Prove that all’a right and perfect, 1 deuyz
