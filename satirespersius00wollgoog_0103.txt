While reason's power restrain'd the struggling will,
Seli-conquer’d, and new-fashion'd by your skill.
With you I spent whole days of lengthen’d light,
And stole our meals from the first shades of night.
Our rest and lahour we together shar’d,

Relaxing only while we simply far’d.

And both our destinies are marked as one.
Whether true Fata, in Libra's equal scales,
Together weighs us, as its ray prevails3

Or while the influeuee of the Twins presides,
Between the two our faithful hearts divides:
Sost'ning stem Satum with our friendly Jove,
Sure some lrind Planet blends our mutual love.

Another rota in stews—hut when they' ve felt,
ln their swell'd joints, hard as the knotted tree,
The stony gout, they then begin to see

Their days in gross and dull existence pest,
And wasted life, too late, benail at last.
