rue enonas or noanon. 121

Or watchee in the sholter'd mead

The lowing cattle aa they feed3

Prese'd honey stowe in ¹jars tokeep‚

Or ehoare the weak and ten'der sheep3
And when ripe fruita adom the year,
And Autumn'a yellow gista appear,
What joy to pluok the grafted pear,

Or purple grapa, hio former care l

A gift, Priapus ! to thy shrine 3

Father sylvanus, or, to thino.

’ris hie to court the ilex' ehade,

Or rest upon the matred blado,

While down the neighbouring hillook'a side
The scanty wetere goutly glide;

And birds pour forth their plaintive lays,
And near the bubbling sonulain plays3
Sounds that in distent murmure areop,
And softly soothe‚ and tempt to sleep. 30
But when J ove' s wintry thunders sound‚
And rains and snow·storms gether round,
Then the fieroe boor, with dogs beset,
He drives upon th’ opposing net ;

Or lighter toils, from bueh to bush,
Stretohes lo oatoh the hungry thrueh3

Or should a hare, or wandering crane,

By chance fall in, that chance is gain.

Who with such pleasures would compare

Love's evils and unoeasing care? 40
