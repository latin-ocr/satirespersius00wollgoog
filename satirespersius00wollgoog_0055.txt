THE SECOND

SATIRE OF PERSIUS.

m

ΤΟ PLO'I'IUS MACRINUS.

—n———aa

Mirm with the whitest stone this welcome mom

On which, Macrinus 1 Thou 1 my friend! wast born.
To thy good Genius pour the choicest wine.

Thou art not one of those wh0, at the shrine
’ of venal GodS, bribe high for what they soek,

And ask no boon they dare aloud to speak.

But half our nobles in still whispers pray,

And secret off ’rings on the altar lay. .

Few are there in the temple's daily crowd,

Who s'oom such hicke, and think and wish aloud. 10
Good sense, fidelity, and honest fame,

¹ These to the public freely they proclaim3

'l'hen drop the voice, the tongue scarae aids the bresith,
‘⁴ O 1 might a pompous funeral mark the death ‘¹'

“ Of my rich uncle! Would kind fate allow

“A hoard of gold to chink beneath my plough!
