THE FIRST SATIRE.

—.-

'l'nh object os this Satira appears to beto expone the bad tante of the
Poets of the day, And as Nero wasone os them, it may be supposed
that the Poet ventured to glauce nt him and his verses, though it can
hardly heimagined that he would dare to aim at him personally, or to
quote or ridicule any compositions known to be his. 'Ihe humour of

the phrodies οι· quotations is necesharily lost with the works they allude
to. But he does not attach Poeh only. The practice of the Recitations,
the subjecta recited, and the impurity which the audiences delighted in,
are also exposed-and the bad tante of the Bar-oratory falls under his
lauh. He ooncludes hydepreeating the praise of those he thinks un-
worthy to form any judgment on the merit os his verset.
