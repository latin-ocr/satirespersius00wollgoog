THE FIF'I'H suumn 012 ruuswr. 77

But you in books delighting night und day,

Grow pale with study, while you leod the wey

To youthful mindo, und pour into the ear

Preoepts and mles, which Zeuo's school might henr.

Seek then, both old ond young, from truths like these,

Thut certain eim which life's last ceree may ease.
“This shall be done tomorrow'’-<⁸l o deley

Occurs tomorrow-“ What theu, is one day 80

. · So great aboonl” But when thet sun hos chone,

Your yesterdoy's to·morrow will be gone;

And then another comes-days drive on yeure3

But still another in advanoe appears. .

Like wheels beneoth oue perch end close in view,

· In vain the hindmoet you the first pursue.

.“ Freedom we went ''--but not thet empty nuruum
Which gives to any Publius a claim
To take his ticket sor hio mouldy stuff.
Ο ignoranti to think it were enough
By one short turn true freedom to bestow,¹1⁰¹
And make a Roman by a single blow.
Here's Dama, one not worth e groot, or half,
Bleerey'd-rt cheat-who lies, ond steole your cheli-
But morl the change‚—whisk’d round within a span,
He’s Morcus Dama, end e Gentlemcn.
N o one ocu seer e creditor to he,
When Marcus offers his security:
When Morcus sits in judgrhent, who uecds dread
Anunjustsenteucei Morcuethus has seid- 100
