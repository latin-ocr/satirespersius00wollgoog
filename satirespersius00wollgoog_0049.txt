This passage is considered as 11111111111111110 comedy, “ 11
mores”-to satire, “in luxum”-aad tovtregedy, “ia prandia regum,”
11 allusion to the story oi Thyestesr aad this distinction has been
observed in the translation. The whole passage irorn 1911110201
the translation, and 63 tc 68 01 the original, is the supposed language oi
the flattering friend, and has reference to l. 823.

This is one 01 the 11011 puzaling passages 10 11 met with in those
Satires. The explanatione given to it are various. lt is probabis that
sonte particular poemia alluded to, in which the several subjecte spe-
cilied were jambled together3 and the redcctioa most probably intended
to hc eonveped seems tc be, that those who cannot describe 11110011-
monest objects in tolerable verse, yet attempt heroice and a high 11111111

,11 poetry. But adiffieulty lies 11 applying this idea tc the subjecte
alluded to in the three last oi these lines, which, though they are oon-
neoted with and might iollow a description 01 the country.. are net oi 1111
sarae huurble character as those which precede them, and might iurnish
or belong t'o a higher strala oi poetry.

The Satire is, in these quotations or imitatione, directed against
some aeli-known pocms oi the day. The first is probably 1 line ironia
tragedy oi Pacuvius. ln translating these passages, the objectis to
show that it was intended 1ο ridicule them hut the humour 11 1011 with
the original verses, though the bombastic absurdity is sufficiently obvious
as a subject oi satire. hiae 95 in the original is supposed 1ο allude to
some poem on llanaihal’s passage into ltuly.
