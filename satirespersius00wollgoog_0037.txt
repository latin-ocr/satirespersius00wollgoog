Examina well this ‘ Bravo) and then see
What trash may not excite such extasy?
May not mad Aooius’ Iliad make its claim?
And our young nobles soek to gain a name
. By some poor sonnet, or suoh lines as those
Who loll on citron couches may composa?
Withaohoioe dish you make your table smoke, 80
Or give a ragged friend a worn-out oloak,
Thon oall for Trnth—“ tell me hut truth‚” you ary,
“ Oh! if you love me, no more flattery !''
But how oan they speak out? lf you mill know,
Yon tritis, bald-pate! sse that paunoh belowffl)

Ο J anns ! happy in thy double face!

,, Safe and proteoted from unsoan grimaoel

From peoking finger, and from gihss aud susem,
Provok’d hy wagging hands, like asses’ ears,
From lolling tangue, such as tha Appulean hound 00
Panting with thirst drops almost to the ground !
But you! Patrician youths i whose soulls are blind,
Watch well your jaering friends, and look behind ἔ
’ But still you ask “ what does the publio say Y'
What! but that now at last is found the way,

, To give to verse its soii harmonious flow,

To smooth its rugged juncturos-and to know,

As with alins, its mensures how to scan.

Whether He ridiculos the ways of man‚‘¹⁰’

Rails at his luxury-or higher things 100
Attempting, points the bloody feasts of kings,

Our matohless Bard such lofty subjecta sings.
