THE unrnn SATIBE ΟΡ Pnnsws. 49

Yon ere well taught and old enough to know,
How on gross mornls censure to bestow‚
For you the painted Portioo have sought‚ (7)
And seen how Greeks with trouser’d Persiens fought.
Where fed with husks end cehe, end shorn by rnle,
The sleepless youths wetoh o’er their rigid school.
And by the brenehing Samiam-letters guidem
You ohoose the right, and leave the len nside.
Still do you snore‚ end let your muddled head, Ι
From last night’s feast, drop liseless on your bed, 80
anning with jsws unhing’dl-whst is your eiml
Will you on trifling fancies rest your fame?
Pelt orows with mud‚ regnrdless of the wey

⁵ Your feet moy leod, end live from day to dayl

’uis vein a course of medicine to begin,

When l'ntal dropsy swells the blonted skin.
Oheok growing ills3 prevent the dire disesse ;
Why promise Craterus large heeps os sees?
Leern solid wisdom, thoughtless rnen l and pouse—
Observe of all eround the finel cause—‘⁹’ 90
Think what we ere, end for what ends design'd3
How we may best thro' lise's long menes wind3
What we should vvish for—how we may diseern
The bounds of wealth,'snd its true uses leern3
How fix the portion whioh we ought* to give
uo friends, relations, country-how to live
As fite our station3 and how best pursue
What God hes plno’d us in this world to do. ‘¹⁰'
