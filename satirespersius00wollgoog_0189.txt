’'l'was night, the moon illumined bright
The starry eanopy3

All nature's powers thou dared'st invoke: ν *32

“While wolves the lambs shall chase,
“While fell Orion on the seas
“ Shall stir the wintry blast,
“While Phoebus' looks shall catch the breeze,
“ Our mutual love shall last.’'
Neoera! thou wilt sorely grieve
To feel my honest pride ;
How could I bear thou shouldst receive·
My rival by thy sidet
<Itoo will find another friends
Nor shall thy form prevail;
Offended once, Love's transporta end
In grief, attractions fail.
Thou happier man 1 whate’er thy name,
Exulting in my fall3 Δ
Tho' rich possessione give thee fame,
Pactolus at thy eall,
