THE THIRD SATIRE.

-.—-—-·

Tur commencement ol this Setino, which represents e 'lutor τυπείης
lrls sleepy pupils, and compleiuing oi their idleuess, und oi their excuses
ior not proceeding with their studies, iuruishcs one oi those amusing ln·
stunces, thut in erl eges, und all euchirius, similer situations eud circum·
stences produce similer leelings und persicus. This scene ut e Roman
school might, by e simple purody, be mede to represent the lunguege
end conduct ol e set oi English school-boys. The digression from thence

leads to much vulueble und interestlng admonition und remonstrence
on ihc indolence und dulness oi some (v. 20 to 24), theurrogunce and
pride ol others (v. 24 tu 30). and thc profligate turn oi mind end hnbits
ol many (v. 31 to 34). The general object oi the Sutire seems to be
to reclulm the young nobillty from their idle end vicinus practices.

The Poet elludes to the delecte ol his own educetion in alight end easy
strelu, end ridicules the Stoic Philosophy, which might be expected to
protect its followers irom the consequences ol euch delecte end errore.
