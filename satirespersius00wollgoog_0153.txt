THE EPODES OF HORACE.

Thus feasting,'what a grateful sight,
Το watch the well-fed flock at night,

Come trotting home3 or, pacing slew, ⁹

The oxen with th’ inverted plough ;
And slaves thatin rich farma abeund,
Drawn up the household gods amand!
Thra epoke the Uaurer, fix'd his gain
In land t’ invest and turn a swain.

But soon convinced that banda were best,
Again all goes at intereat3

And scorea, on former Idea defaced‚
Returning Calends saw replaced.

Epona ΙΙΙ. To Maecenas.

Heneeforth whoe'er has used his knife
Τό shorten an old father’s life,

A dose of deadly garlic send him,
Hemloak is not more sure to end him.
What stomachs must our labourers have!
What poison this, that makes ma rava!
Were my herbe soak'd in viper's blood?
Or has Canidia cook’d my food?
Medea, when, all chiesa above,

On J ason’s form she fix'd her love,
With thas prepared, she daub'd him 0'er‚
To yoka the bulla untamed before.
