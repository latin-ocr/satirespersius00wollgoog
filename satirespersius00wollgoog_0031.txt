· Ο conns of man! alas! how vain! how wenk 1<1>

Monitor. Say who will read such lines? P. '1¹0 mo
d'ye speak?

M. Not one I sny. P. Not one? M. Yes, one or two,
Shamefnl and sad! P. Why? ‘²' Lestthe Trojan orew

· Led by Polydamas, to me prefer

A soribbling Labeo—should I make a stin,

Or mind such triflos? In Rome’s turbid state,
If Oritics a false soalo should elevate,

And authors in uneqnal balance weigh,

Follow not thou the humour of the day 3

Think for thyself, and seek no other fame,

For all at Rome ore·- ))) what I dare not name.

- But 'tis nllowoble¹ to speoh one's mind,

When now at length to solemn thoughts inolin'd‚ ‘⁴'
Grey hairs advnnoe, and maroles ore laid by,

And we assume a stem severity 3
Theo, then, excuse it-M. No, not e'en then.
