Nhat other tribute must l payl

Tell me, I’m ready to obey :

Whether a hundred beasts you claim,
A saorifioe to your dread name3

Or sounding notes os praise require,
From that false instrument, the lyre,
And wise and pure would proudly move
Amongst the brightest stara above.

The brothers, vax'd at Heleu’s shame,

' Both powersul and great in name, ¹
Yet did not humble prayersdaspise,
But gave the Poet bach his eyes :

Do, sor thouoan’st, then, Ι implore,

¹ My mind relieve, my sense restore3

Ο thou! that wast not by thy lot,

By parents base or mean begot ;

Who noyer with old women’e aare,
Did’st grub, or seattar to the air,

On the ninth day, the poor man’s duetl
Thy heart ir kind, thy actions just.
