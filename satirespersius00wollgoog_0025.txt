THE PROLOGUE.

—---.

Ι Nnvmt sipp'd the boos-struck fount, ‘¹'
Nor on the double-&ested mount,

My head in dreaming fancy laid,

And waked a Poet ready-made.

I leave the Muses’ sacred hill,

And pale Pirene’s moumful rill,‘²’ , .
Το those around whose sculptured heads
The creeping ivy fondly sprends.

A half-bred bard, my humble line

1 offer at the Poet's shrine.

Who has the parrot taught to borrow

Our language‚ and to cry “ Good morrow P’'
Or made the magpie streoeh her beak,

And words like our's attempt ω speak?

An empty stomach‚ toacher fit

Of mimic tones, of art, and wit.

Let gold but glitter in their eyes,‘⁸’
Trust me the very choughs and pies,
Poets and Poetesses fair,

Will chanta Pegasean airss
