“Why should foul leprosy and jaundioe spare

“ Thut suffering ward of mine, to whom I’m heir?

“O could I but extinguish his frail life!

'Phat these your vows may meet with due regard,

No rites are thought too frequent or too hard,

For twice and thrioe eaeh mom your head you lave,

And purge the stein of night iu Tiber's ware.

But stay, good siri I would one question try, ‘³’
What think you of this God, this Jove on high?
Wouid you prefer that he should hear your prayer,
Or some oue here below i—Staiusi you stare l
Is there a J udgewho better knows the laws, <⁰

A finer guardian iu au Orphau's causei 30

Defeud us, mighty Jove! would he exelaim !

And will not Jove ory out in his own namet

Thiuk'st thou because the thunder's threateniug shook ‘⁵’ “
Glanoes above thy head, aud speres thy flook,

But strikes the shatter'd ouh, that thou and thine

Nor lies thy eorpse across th’ assumed spot, (θ) 40'

Or that by flattery eoax’d‚ aud daiuties pleas’d‚

The easy Gods will wink und he eppeas'di
