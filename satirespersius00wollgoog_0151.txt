. B'ut if a ehaate and prudent wife
Sweetens and ahares the illa os life,
And tends the household, aa we're told
'Phe Sabine women did of old3
Or mariting the virtuous name
Apulia’s sun-burnt matrona claim,
On the pure hearth ’tis her delight
To atrew the well-dreaa’d loga each night,
And har returning husband wait
When labour'e 0’er, fatigued and late 3 50
If she the hurdled cattle tenda,
And home th' o'erflowing produce aends3
With sweet fresh wine her partner greets,
And spreads his board with unbought meata3
Not more the Lucrina Lake to ma
Its oysters yields, nor eastern aea
Turhots and chara, when winteffs wind
Drivaa on, and leavea its atores behind3
Nor do Ι taste and swallow down
Haathcoeks and fowls of high renown, 60
With half tha neat that from my fielda
The rich well-chonen olive yielda3
Or the low sorrel, or the leaf

Of hemely mallon, the relies

Of stomaeha sich-or for a guest,

On festal dayS, a lamhkin diest,

Or tender kid, in lai-der stored,

Saved from the wolf to grace our heard.
