THE mm SATIRE OF entismo.

· Yon write in gentle and iu sooial phrase, (⁸¹

Words neatly fitting, strokes that lightly grato,
That tenderly the pallid ohoek exposa,
And faults with just, yet mild rebuke disolose.
Go on then-leave Myoeuae's feasts of blood,
With head, and feet3 and stiok to humbler food.
Persius. I aim not for my trifles to assume ‘⁴'
A turgid style, that would give weight to fumo.
All this is private: but to thee, dear friend l
The musa invites my bosom thoughts to send.
Try-siit thern well-aud sae how large a share,
Cornutus! in my grateful mind you bear:
Strikel ring my heart, none better knows than you,
What whole and solid sounds, what's seign’d, what true. 30
For this would Ia hundred voices ask,
With honest sounds to aid the pleasing task
of showing to the world how olosely press’d
Within the inmost loldings of my braant,
What noue can sea-no outward sign ean prove,
How deeply seated is my constant love.
The gown thrown off that oheok'd the timid boy 3 (⁵)
'l'he Lares' nsok hung with the east-off toy3r ¹
Midst gay young friends, by my new honours known3

And free to seek all quartem ol the town3 40
Donbtful what course to take, with none to guida,

And prone in winding patho to step aside; ·

For refuge to your friendly oare I flew,

And found a fostering Socrates in you.
