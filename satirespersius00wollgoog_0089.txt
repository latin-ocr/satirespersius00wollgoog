’Tis he who speaks-Say then, how stende your claim?
Sey, you who rest on Pericles’ great neme,

Genius, forsooth! with lively sense appears3

You know exnnssy, in the noisy throng,

When oo speek out, ond when to hold your tongue3

When rules deceive, end force her to incline.

Androne oen guilt with surer judgment try,

Or the bleok theta with more nuth epply.‘²’
