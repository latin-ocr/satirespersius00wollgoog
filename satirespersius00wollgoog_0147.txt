1⁸11ss Euenus OF HORACE·

But tho' 'in this, or any war,

. To please you Ι would venture iar3

Think not I wish you to bestow

More oxen on my labouriug plough;
Or in tho dog-days to exohange '
Lucanio’o for Calabria’s range;

Or that my villa’s glittering hall
Should reaoh to Tusculum’s high wall:
Enough your bounty hus supplied,

And more-nor would Ι wealth provide
To hide, like Chremes in the play,

Or, like a spendthrift, throw away.

-μ

Eronrr ΙΙ.

Happy the man, who, for from care,
As they who lived before uo were;
With his own oxen tills his land,

And leurs no usurer’s griping hand:
Whom no shrill trumpet calls to arms,
Nor Ooean’s angry wave alanus:
Who always shuns the Forum’s strifo,
Nor courts the great to lead their life:
But round the poplar loves to twine
The teudrils of the oreeping wine3

And pruning off the uselesslshoot, -
Grasts healthier stems and better fruit;
