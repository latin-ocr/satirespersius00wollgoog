(l) Line l. 0 nares oj'muof alos! how vain! how wenkl

'lhe opening of this Satira requires some explanation. The Poet
may be supposed to he repeating to himself the first line of his oornpo-
sitien, when his friend eomes in und overhears him, and he tells him
that, in the taste of the town at that time, such serious reflectione would
not be listened to. 'lhe Poet remonstrates, bnt the friend perseveres in
stuting that perhaps one or two, but not more, might be indneed to read
his lines, but that it would be hard upon him, and a sad disappointment.
“ Why s0?’' says Persius. “Do yon thinlr leare, though a poor seribbler,
such as Labeo, may be preferred to me ?‘' and hethan proceeds to justify
himself, and to enter upon the subject he had proposed-nnmely‚ to
exposa the bad taste of the Poets of the day, and of the publio that
encouragedthem'

(2) Line 4-6. Lest ide Trrp‘an creso,
Led by Polydamas, io me prefer
A soribblinp Labeo.

Some have imagined that the Emperor Nero and his court are
alluded to under the names of Polydamas and the Trojans, but it is
probable that this passage in Homer (ll. 22, v. loo-5) was familiar to
tha Romans, and had become aoommou cant expression, upplionble to
any case when the reproaches of idle and ignorant persons might ho
apprehended. Gifford oonsiders it in this light.
