Wnrr, always thus? ’tis aow almost broad day,

And the small ohink admits the expanding ray;

We snore, enough to ohaoa the fumos of wine,

While tha fifth shadow touohes on the line.

What mean you t at this hour the dog-star's fire

Parohes the sarth, and bids the flooks retira.

“ Is it then day T' says one of the gay set.

“ How my bila swells.'' He bursts, ho roars, you’d swear

All thaAroadian herdswerebraying near. 10
Now comes the Book set out upon its stand,

The parchment sorap’d, the papor in his hand, ‘¹’

The knotted read prepart'rd with pointed tip;

“ This inh,” he ories, “grows thiok at ev'ry dip,

“ See how it stickS‚'’ put water to it then—

“'N0w it's too light, it drops from off the pen.’'
Ο wretoh aad doubly wretoh! what, como to this!

Go homo then, and for pap your mother kias, ¹
