Bassus, in which the wisdom oi tha sagea, and the noble actions oi the
heroes, oi ancient times had been celebrated, or ιο some lighter poem, in
which the philosophers oi his own time had been satirized gently and
without severity. Both Madau and Gifford give the more serious luter·
pretation. Giliord’s lineis,
