Paratus expiare, seu poposceris
Centum juvencos, sive mendaci lyra
Voles sonari, “ tu pudica, tu proba,

‘⁴ Perambulatis astra, sidus aureum.''
Infamia Helenae 'Castor offensus vice,
Fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece
Ademta vati reddidere lumina.

Et tu, potes uam, solve me dementiis,
Ο l nec paternis obsoleta sordibus,
Nec in sepulchris pauperum prudens auu's ·
Nouendiales dissipare pulveres.

Tibi hospitale peetus, et purae manus*

Nota-The lines 50 and the two following oi the original, which
have been the subject oi much commentam, and various attempta at
explanation, romain obscure3 aud have -beeu omitted on account oi
their indelicacy as well aa their difficulty. The most satisfactory iuter-
pretatiou seems to be, that there nus a person, named Pactumeius,
whom Canidia called her son, but who uvas suspected to have been

stolen by her-und the turn oi the lines‘is ironieah as admittiug the
birth aud the cousequenees oi it, though Canidia shewed no appearance .
oi having beon delivered.
