- “ 01 why should 1 stand shivering here?
“ Why taunted-I 1111111 you, 111- 10
“ With a harsh step-damah 11111 onear?
“Why snarl'd 11, like 111111 11 bay ?”

Such was the trembling boy’e lament‚

'As stripp'd, and fix’d to earth, he strove ;
A spotleas sorm and innocent,

Which e'en a 'l'hraoian’s beart might move.

But unabash’d Canidia stands,

Her head uneomb'd, with tangled hair,
And stunted snakes in twisted bands;
Thon bids her fiands from 111111 11 tear 20

6.

Tha fig-tree, and the cypress shoots‚
And egga with blood of toads besmear'd,
The samech-owl's wing‚ the poisonous roots
In Colchos and lieria roar’d, ’

'l'he fragments os the atarving hound,

From his olos’d foaming grindera 11111;
8111111111 1111111 111 gathers round,
Such to th' enchanted flame 111 11111.
