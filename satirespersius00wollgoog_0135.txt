“ But tell me what is leil l” Left! do you ask? 100
¹ Thon spond away, my boyl be it your task .

Το dress my greens with sauros rich and good.

But you would have' me live on homely food, .

A mess of nettles on a feast display,

And a smok'd pigss-head on aholy day,

That your rioh grandson, pamper’d with high food,

May wasta his life on dames of noble blood,<¹³l

And while half-starv’d my dwindled form Ι show,

His pamper'd paunoh may swell and swag below.

Sell then your soul for gain—traffio: run o’ar 110
All quartsrs os the globo-increase your storo:

Let no experieno'd dealor better know,

His well-sed slaves in their close oaga to show.
Douhle your capital-“ 'tis done-and then

“ From three, and four-fold, Ι advanoe to ten-

“ Where shall I stop? Chrysippus, berny friend 11¹⁶>
“ Teach me thy growing heap intimato end.''
