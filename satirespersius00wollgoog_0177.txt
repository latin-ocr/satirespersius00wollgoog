rer aronae or norror. 149

The Gaulo in thousands‚ at this sight,
Their ioaming steede indignant wheel’d, ' 20
ν Changing the fortune of the fight,
Shouting for Oaeear in the field: Α
And ships that hostile eueooure bore,
Haste back to port, andreoli the shore.

Triumphant God! prepare thy oar,
rhy ¹viotims by the yoke untried.
No hero in J ugurtha'e war,
Not even Scipio in hie pride,
From Carthago brought such glory home: 30
The ruin'd walle his noblest tomb.

Foriorn‚ and beat by land and eea,
His purple robe the chief lays down,
In mourning looks for sympathy‚
And seeke the towers oi Crete's iamed town3
Or, driven by ill-fated galas,
'Midst rocks and sande uncertain seila.

Boyi bring us larger dranghts to-niglrt, Ι
Of Chion andos Lesbian store3
- Or, to provoke the appetite,
Strong Oaeouban in goblete pour! ¹ 40
Let ue forget our late alarona ’
For Caesar'e sate, in Baoehns' cherma.
