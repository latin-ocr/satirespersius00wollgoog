Enough-the signatore of Morcus see!
The cop does this-eo much for Liberty!
“ But who is truly free, if not the men
“ Who ao he likes oon live? end thot Ι ean.
“Am Ι not free os BrutuW ⁴⁴ Stop, my friend‚'
“The promises Ι grant, but not the end.''
With ear acute henr the sharp Stoio cry,-
“Your eoo and will and freedom Ι deny.''
“But since I'm by the Praetor's wend dismies’d‚
“And my 'own moster, why not as I list 110

“ Follow my wnywnrd whimsi except indeed
“The low forbide; its rubriok as Ι read.”
Listen awhile! end smooth thet wrinkling frown,

While all this old wife's gosnip Ι put down.

'Tis not the Praetor's office, et his will,

A sense of tendet dutiee to instil 3

Orthe free use of busy life to give

To sools who heve not studied how to live.

As weil might a musioian tune his lyrn,

And bid a gowky footboy etrike the wire. 120
Reeson forbids‚ and claime to interfere,

Whispering her leesons in th' unwilling eor:

Think it n orime perversely to pureue

What you must spoil, if yon attempt to do.

Weak mindo, from things above their power to soan,(¹¹’

. Nature restrainS, end the known lawe of man.

Doctors forbid you to pretend to mix
The patient's dose, unskill'd the scale to fix.
