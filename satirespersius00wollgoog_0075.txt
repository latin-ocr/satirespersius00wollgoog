UHE umen SA'HRE OF PERSIUS.

Fether of Gods! when Tyronte’ wild desire (⁵³
Prompts them to eote whioh rouee thy vongeful ire,
When baneful luet provokes their fieroe intent,
And teiuts their blood‚—Be thie their punishment!
To see before them virtue’s brilliant roy,

And pine ond wither es they turn ewey!

From the fem'd Bull did groone more piteous break,
Or deedlier ieors the guilty oonsoienoe shake

Of him, who in his purple robe anay'd,

Sow from the gilded roos th' impending bledo 3
Thon pieroe the wretoh, who muttere with affright‚
“ I sink! 1 eink to everlosting night,’'

And stung by oousoienoe darer not to disolose

E’en to his wife the secret of his woes i

Ost when o boy I made my eyelide emam, (θ’
Rather than take the peine to lemn by heom,

And spout the dying Ceto's pompour speech,
Which my poor silly moster lov’d to teooh,

And my fond sother brought his friends to heor3
Sweating for my success, with anxious feor3

Not without cause z ior truly every thought
Was flx’d on what the happy dice-box brought,
When sine oeme uppermost3 and what the loss,
When ooo appear’d under the luokleee tose:
How in the bottle'e neck the throw to win,
And make the whirling top most strongly opin.
