aaa anonas oxa-nonnon- 145

Nor is the untamed Briton now

Destined to tread the triumph's course3 10
Alas! the fatal Parthian vow!

That Rome should fall by her own force!

But neither wolf nor lion turns
His fangs 'gaiust any of his kind:
What impulse guidae? what madness burna?
Tell me 3—what guilt infesta your mind?

l

You’reailent-soethepallid hue, ,
The look of stupor and of shame:
This vangeanoe to our crimes is due,
A brother’s alaughtar taints our name. 20

’na Remus’ blood that stains the earth ε

His guiltlesa blood we now deplore3
Fatal to those who sinae had birth,
Fatal to ages· yet in otora.

Epona VIII. Not fit to be translated.
