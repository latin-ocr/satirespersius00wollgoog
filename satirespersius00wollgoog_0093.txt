· But while you thus indulge and live at ease,
Some prying luove may follow you, and squeeze
Your elhow as you pass, and with diaguot,
Rail at your soeret aud unmanly lustu)

’uis thus we live—we deal about our blowo,
But leave some limb unguarded to our foas.
Au uloer freto you, which you strive to hide

Under the goldeu belt diaplay’d with pride3
Oheal others, aud yourself too if you ean.

“ But if my neighbours hail me as the man

“ For worth aud wiodom valued far and near,

‘⁶ Must I not then believe iu what I hearl’'
What! while you sichen at the sight of goldl l
While your vile passione revel unooutroll'dl
While, guarded well, you nightly roam about,
And lash the Puteal with your uoisy routl

Iu vain the rahhle’s ohouts shall greet your earo.

'l'hrow off the mesu, let others olaim those* oheero3

Look to yourself-and you oan hardly guess
How scanty is the sooch that you possess.
