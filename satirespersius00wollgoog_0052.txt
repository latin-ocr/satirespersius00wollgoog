(93) Last line. Edicta by day, at m'glrt Callirhd'e.

The last line in this Satira has been the subject oi much leained

aud idle commentary and conjecture. At the best, the meaning can
only bc guassed at. Whether this Callirhde was a courtesan, or an
actaea, or whatever character or person she might have been intended
to represent, isvunlsaown, and mast remeia so. The Delphin edition
gives the easiest aud simplest explanation ol the passage. “Talibus
hominibus imperitis at ineptis, artium liberalium et scientiarum incapaa
cibus, mando et indulgeo occupationes dignas se. Forum manepetant, r
ubi praetoris edicta excipiant, vacent avaritiae et ioenori exigendo. Post

'lhe Translator has tried to adopt several conjectaral interpretations, J
but at last he thought it best to resort to an almost literal translation oi
the line, without attempting to give colliride a character or Edictum a
precise meaning, but leaving both involved in the same obscurit)⁷ in
which he found them. Dr Stoclser observes that notioes wore stuclr on ⁴
the walls like our play-bilis, which the lounger stoppod to read. Cal-
lirhoe may be another mawlsish Poem to ba recitedz-“Da Forum
