(l) L. il. Thea comes the epeeclt-Romaue! thu aeones ambs.

The using the word ‘⁶ Quirites ” in this speech oi the supposed
Alcibiades, is taking otl' the vell, is any was intended to be thrown over
¹this Satire3 and it has baeu thought right to adopt the saure address
iu this translation, though by some the Athenian character is preserved.
'lhe speech is in the lenguage oi ignorance aud inexperience, which it
has been attempted to imitate io tho translation.

(o) a. ra or oo amr aaaron umetmtl appa.

'lhe 'lbeta being the iirst letter ol tbe word Death iu the Greek,
was applied to the names oi those who were capitelly condemned.

(3) L. tl. Hoste io Anticyra, aad drinio lhcjut'cc.

The laleuds oi Anticyra iurnished thc llelebore which was sup-
posed to be a specillo for the oure of insenity. The Post (l. 14) throws
off the ironical veil, end bursts forth against the iolly ond ioppery oi the
supposed Alcibiades-telling him he is mad to think oi governing a
people while he exhibits such instances oi incapacity and absurdity,
and that he should talc Helebore to bring himself tobis senscs.
