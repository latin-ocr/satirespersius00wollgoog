Pythagoras's secret skill,
And Nereus’ form be thiae ;

Thy place another soon shall fill, '
The laugh will then be mine.

Erone XVI. To tlte &moa People.

Age upon age of civil broil succeeds,

And Rome by her own offepring bleeds.

She, whom the neighbouring Marsi could not herm,
Nor Porsena's fieroe banda alarm 3

Nor Capuo'e pride, nor Spartacus demago,

. Nor th' Allobroge, who bears no change;

Nor fieroe Germania's bluoeyed train‚

Nor Hannibal, the mother's bane;

Now falls devoted by our impious reae,
Wild beasts will dow usurp h'er place.

The barbarous conqueror will insult the dead,
While olanking hoofe her pavemerrts troad,
Nor Romulus' deep-buried relies spare,

, Soatter’d, ΟΙ scandal! to the air.

But some, perhaps the better part of Rome, ,
Would shun these ills, and leave their home:
Thea let them follow the Phooaeans’ fate,
Like thern their country execrata ;
