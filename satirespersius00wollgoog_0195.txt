ree renones or norece, 167

The ocean ie before ue, end those ielerr,

Where wealth adeunde, and fortune smiles;

Where yearly produce erowne the untilt’d soil,

And vineyerds flourish without toil;

The olive never faiis to yield its fruit,

Nor the rich fig-tree’s bude to ehoot3

Where honey from· the hollow oak distils,

And murmur eost the bubhling rilis3 50

. Where without call the herde in order stand·

And court the milkrnnn’e friendly hand3

No prowling beer growis end besets the sold,
Nor ewelling tufts the viper hold3

'Phe floeke no murrein'e fell contagion dreadt
No stare their seorehing influence ehed.

More comforts yet-for there no driving raine,
Borne by foul eest winde, sweep the plaine 3

No erops ere wither d hy the sun's fieree bearn 3
Propitioue heav'n girarde each extreme. 60
The Argo reeeh'd not thie untninted shore,

Nor thither the bold Colchien bore;

There no Sidoniae erews were known to land,
Nor vex'd Ulyseee' wandering bend. =
