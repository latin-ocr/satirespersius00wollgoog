The superstitious aunt or grandem wehes,
And from his bed the elumbering infant takes:
Then with her witehoraft and her nauseous oharms,
Guards him from evil eyes—and in her arms
Fondling her feeble hope, her puny boy, r
Adde pray'rs to wishes, that he may enjoy 50
Crassus’s palaees, Licinius’ fields,
And confidently gives what fortune yields.
“ May some great King and Quaen, by beauty won,
‘⁴ Adopt,’' she ories, “my derling as their son!
“ May virgins rush the favour'd youth to greet i
“ And roses spring where'er he sets his feet.”
If such the nurse's prayer, deny her, Jove!
'l'ho' eloth'd in white she supplicate thy love.
You ask for health and vigorous old age.
A fair request enough! but then the rege 60
For well-stor’d dishes with rich sauses drusi,
Clreoks the kind Gods, aud blights the warm request.
With bulloehs elain you bribe the God of gold,
And urge your household Gods to bless your fold.
‘⁴ Give me but fruitful herds! I ask no more''- „
Fooli with what feoe ean you the Gods implore,
, While cauis of roasted heifers melt in greasei
And yet by these He sues for an increase, (Β)
Adding rioh cahos—and “now they grou, they breed,
“ My fields, my flooks,'' he ories, “my vows succeed1'' 70
“ Now, even now’'-till hopeless and deprest
In vain one penny sighs within his chest.
