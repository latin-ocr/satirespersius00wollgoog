(7) L. 51. Anu Iethira aot his piotm’d miserim show.

A similer allusion to shipwrecked snilora carrying about with them
aorne representation oi their misiortune‚ in order to attreot attention and
charity, occurs before, Satire l, line 89, “cum fracte in trabe pictum
Ex humero μοι-ιη’· The same practice is familiar to us.

(8) L. 58. But Bestius roilo ot ol! stis Greciart tore, dc. ·

Bestius may be intended to represent some covetons tegam-huntur,
who is angry that philosophers should have recommended and taught
generosity, and that the custom of expensive funereis should have
been introduced, which diminiehetestotor’s effecte ln the transla-
tion no attempt has been mede to give eny interpretation to the
words “maris expen' (line 29 orie), which hos so divided and
puzzied the commentatore. Whether “maris” is to be taken as the

genitive cose ot “ mas,'' or ot ‘⁴ mare‚” in either case the expression is
obscure, and not easily reconciled with the context. lt is most probable
that Persius adopted the phrase from Horace (Sat 8, Ι. 21. 19), but
how does'he appiy it? Dr Stocker interprete these words ‘⁴ went osman-
liness.” '

let him know what Ι will do, ii hs complains oi my spending my money.
