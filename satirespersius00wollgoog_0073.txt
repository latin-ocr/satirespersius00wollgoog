Like noble imps, or unfledged birds, be fed, ‘¹’ ,
Ans aeream aas irak when you are nnn to ses. n
‘⁴ Look at my pen, how ean I write l'' uo me

Repeat such idle storiesl you must see

You waste your time, are laugh'd at, and despis'd:
ill-bak'd‚ ill-'sounding oups are never priz’d:

· Your clay still soii-then let the wheel go round,
While yet the potter’s hand may turn you sound.

But a paternal farm you have obtain'd,

Enough for use-a salt-cellar unstain'd ι <n ’

Thou be content—what have you more to wish,

While smokes thealtar from the sacred dishl 30
Why pride yourselss'and puff, and boast, and blow,
Because some genealogist ean show

How, in degree a thousand times remov'd‚

Your Tusoan origin ¹can still be prov'dl

Because, when passing robed in knightly style, (⁴³

You great your oou'sin Censor with a smilel

Such trappings for the moh-I know you well, ⁴

And all your inmost thoughts and turns ean tell.

Are you not, then, asham'd'to court the fate

osone like Natta, a vile profligate?

But he's so stupified and senseless grown,

. To his iat sels his loss is soareely known,

And he escapes all blame—but sunh he lies

Deep in the flood‚ never again to rise-
