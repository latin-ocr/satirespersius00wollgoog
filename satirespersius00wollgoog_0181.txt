Eeoen XI. Το Pettius.

Ne longer, Pettius, es before,
Ι scribble verses by the score3
More serious leve now blinds my eyes,
And all my senses occupies.
, Leve, which et ell times mede me bum

For this seir form, cr thet, in turn.
,The third December now hes pest,
And shom the ferests by its blest,
Since for Inachie'e cherms I reved3
Ο whet e locd of shcme I've ceredi 10
1 was the talk of all the town:
My sollies I don’t like to own3
How over the convivial bowl
My looks betrey'd my captured soul;

¹ My silence, end my lenguid eye,
And from the breast the deep-setch'd sigh 3
“ What, then, shall the ingenucus mind
“By poverty be sc cenfined?
‘⁴ shall love by weelth elene be gein’di''
To thee thus oft I heve complain’d‚ 20

When werm'd by wine, what ley conceel'd,
Wes by th' unguerded God reveeled.
